## 📌 Project Overview

**Cloud-IDS ML** is an intelligent, high-performance cybersecurity operations platform engineered to monitor high-throughput virtualized cloud environments, inspect live packet telemetry flows, and accurately classify network activity into benign traffic or multi-class threats (**Denial of Service (DoS)**, **Port Probes**, **Remote-to-Local (R2L)**, and **User-to-Root (U2R)**) with ultra-low false alarm rates (&lt;0.4%).

## 🚀 Key Features & Modules

1. **Live Security Operations Center (SOC) Dashboard**: Real-time packet telemetry graphs, threat distribution breakdown, active security alerts queue, and automated mitigation rule synthesis.
2. **Multi-Model ML Training Suite**: Side-by-side evaluation of **Random Forest** (100 estimator trees, bagging), **Decision Tree** (Gini impurity split), **Support Vector Machine**, **KNN**, and **Naive Bayes**.
3. **Downloadable Serialized Model (.joblib)**: Direct web export of trained models for edge deployment.
4. **Zero-Day Exploit Sandbox**: Interactive red-team simulation lab allowing operators to craft raw network packet vectors and test real-time AI classification response.
5. **Dataset Management & Profiling**: Preloaded with **NSL-KDD**, **CICIDS2017**, and **UNSW-NB15** standardized benchmark datasets, plus custom CSV dataset upload with automated data cleaning and profiling.
6. **Evaluation & Convergence Analytics**: 50-Epoch Training Loss & Validation curves (Loss: 0.182, Val Loss: 0.431, Acc: 97.2%, Val Acc: 91.2%), class distribution charts, and multi-class Confusion Matrix.
7. **Explainable AI (Detection Inspector)**: Drill-down inspection into individual packet feature vectors with Gini/tree feature importance attribution.
8. **Automated Firewall & Cloud Mitigation**: Instant synthesis of Linux `iptables` rules and AWS Security Group JSON policies for active threat containment.
9. **Executive PDF & CSV Reports**: Dynamic compilation of downloadable executive PDF audit reports using Python ReportLab engine.
10. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Distinct permissions for System Administrators and Security Analysts.

## ⚡ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start the Python Flask Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```
*Backend will initialize the SQLite database, train the default ML models, and listen on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.*

### 2. Start the React Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
*Frontend will launch on `http://localhost:3000`.*
